    <div class="accord-content">
        The snow leopard or ounce (Panthera uncia) is a large cat native to the<br>
        mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on<br>
        the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because the global population is<br>

        10% in the next 23 years.<br>
